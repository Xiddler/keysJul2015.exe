# keysJul2015.exe
AHK keybindings
This is a .exe file compiled from an autohotkey(.AHK) file using the compiler that comes with autohotkey. This file 
contains the key bindings that I use in my day to day text editing. e.g. to get that e.g. I only had to type 
the letter e followed by the letter g i.e. no periods.In other words, 2 keystrokes instead of 4. The same went 
for that i.e. -- 2 keystrokes.

The key bindings are happening because I have AutoHotKey.exe installed and running AND I have my script called -- clumsily 
enough -- Program_keybindings_01.ahk. But I want to have these key bindings on any computer that I may be using. So, I complied
it into an executable called keysJul2015.exe which I can -- indeed anyone can -- download and use on any computer.

Some other bindings I have -- these mainly mean I don't have to press the shift key
That last don't is in the script. The relevent line in the .ahk script is simply ::dont::don't which menas when I type 
dont the word don't appears.
Here is the list:
::@@y::donagh.mccarthy@yahoo.com
::aa::A{Enter}{Left}
::acd::activate donagh_env1
::aint::ain't
::amd::and
::apx::approximately
::atm::at the moment

::couldnt::couldn't
::ct::Ctrl&

::sp::S_Problem
::shouldnt::shouldn't

::wasnt::wasn't
::wik::wikipedia
::wont::won't
::wouldnt::wouldn't
::wp::WordPress
::youll::you'll
::youre::you're
::yt::YouTube

the @@y is very handy when signing up for stuff on the web 3 keystrokes instead of what 20?

That's all, folk.
